<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wNngN6y/Seat-Wizard.png" alt="Seat-Wizard" border="0">

Seat Management and Booking App enables the user to manage seats and seat booking in Salesforce.
The App implements Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) and utilizes Lightning Web Components. The App can be used both on Desktop and on Mobile.

Admin User can create seats and rooms by drawing on a Canvas with the organization floor as a background, using Rectangle tool or a "Sticky-Line" tool.
After a seat is drawn Admin User can set the seat attributes based on predetermined values.

End Users can book a seat for a day, multiple days, hour/s, based on the organization preferences (managed by Metadata). End Users can search for co-workers' booking and manage their own bookings by using the relevant tabs.
