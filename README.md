<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wNngN6y/Seat-Wizard.png" alt="Seat-Wizard" border="0">

Draw seats on jpeg maps of your organization's floors, setting up the type, attributes and neighborhoods for seats,meeting rooms and etc.

"builders" can draw on an uploaded image: seats,rooms and etc. Making this application reusable for multiple scenarios and needs. Users can make reservations based on the "builders" drawings, search for other coworkers's reservations and managed their reservatrions under "My Reservations" tab for ease of use.

Using Custom Metadata Type for configurations of workdays,workhours and number of weeks available for reservations to suit the company's work schedule.

With Javascript's [Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) we allow "builders" to draw shapes using 2 tools we built: "Rectangle" and "Sticky Line", accessible through the "Builder" tab, to any user with the permission set.
